# SlzAnnoyingMod
A dumb mod made to be annoying and unfair.

## Idea
The idea of the mod is to be a mod that add lots of mildly infuriating(or sometimes things that are straight up infuriating) to make
the gameplay of the end user miserable. For example: There're mixins that: make the player take more fall damage, make creepers have a larger explosion radius, make irom golems
target player by default etc. 
I don't want to add features that make the game impossible to play or that are so unfair that makes the game boring.

## Want to contribute?
If you, for some unknown reason, want to contribute to this shitty project, feel free to do so. The only restriction is that you need to follow the idea of the mod that I stated [here](https://github.com/slz-br/SlzAnnoyingMod/blob/main/README.md#Idea). Besides that, you can do pretty much whatever you want, from creating mixins to adding new mobs,
but this doesn't mean that I'll accept any pull request, if you want to make a contribution but don't know if it's going to be accepted, feel free to create an issue asking if your idea would be accepted, I'll try to answer as quickly as possible.
